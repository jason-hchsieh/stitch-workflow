# Mycelium Workflow

This project uses the mycelium workflow for AI-assisted development.

## Quick Commands

- `/mycelium-plan [task]` - Create implementation plan
- `/mycelium-work` - Execute planned tasks
- `/mycelium-review` - Review code quality
- `/mycelium-capture` - Capture learnings
- `/mycelium-go [task]` - Full autonomous workflow

## Workflow Phases

1. **Context Loading** - Load project context and discover capabilities
2. **Clarify Request** - Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. **Planning** - Break down work into tasks
4. **Implementation** - TDD implementation with verification
5. **Review** - Two-stage quality review
6. **Finalization** - Commit and PR creation
7. **Pattern Detection** - Identify recurring patterns
8. **Knowledge Storage** - Capture learnings

## Project Context

Context files: `.mycelium/context/`
- `product.md` - What and why
- `tech-stack.md` - With what
- `workflow.md` - How to work

## State Management
