You are executing the **/workflow:context-sync** command for context window management during Phase 4.5B.

## Purpose

Manage context window efficiently in long sessions by:
1. Summarizing completed work (≤500 tokens per task)
2. Creating/updating progress checkpoints in `.workflow/state/progress.md`
3. Monitoring context usage levels
4. Spawning fresh agent with compressed context when >80% used

## Context Management Protocol

### Step 1: Assess Context Usage

Check current context state:
- Estimate tokens used in current session
- Calculate usage percentage of context window
- Determine if compression or fresh spawn needed

**Thresholds:**
- **<50% used**: Continue normally, no action needed
- **50-80% used**: Compress non-essential context
- **>80% used**: Spawn fresh agent with handoff notes
- **force-spawn argument**: Always spawn fresh agent regardless of usage

### Step 2: Load Current State

Read existing progress and session state:

```bash
# Read current progress file
cat .workflow/state/progress.md

# Read session state
cat .workflow/state/session_state.json

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check current plan status
cat .workflow/plans/*.md | grep -E "\[(x|~| )\]"
```

### Step 3: Compress Completed Work

For each completed task since last sync:

**Summarize (≤100 words per task):**
- Task ID and description
- Key implementation details
- Commit SHA
- Any decisions made
- Files changed (list only)

**Format:**
```markdown
### ✅ Task X.Y: Brief title (commit-sha)
One paragraph summary focusing on what was done and key decisions.
Do NOT include verbose details or full code changes.
```

### Step 4: Update Progress File

Write or update `.workflow/state/progress.md`:

**Required Sections:**

```markdown
# Session Progress

## Current State
**Track:** {track_id}
**Phase:** {current_phase}
**Task:** {current_task_id} - {task_name}
**Status:** {in_progress|pending|blocked}
**Worktree:** {worktree_path}
**Branch:** {branch_name}
**Context Usage:** {percentage}%
**Last Sync:** {timestamp}

## Completed Tasks

{Compressed summaries of all completed tasks}

## Current Task Details

### Task {id}: {name}
**File:** {primary_file}
**Status:** {status}
**Started:** {timestamp}

**What's Done:**
- {bullet points}

**What's Next:**
- {bullet points}

**Blockers:** {None or list}

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision N: {title}
**When:** Task X.Y
**Why:** {brief rationale}
**Trade-off:** {one-line trade-off}

## Next Up

- [ ] Task {id}: {description}
- [ ] Task {id}: {description}

## Known Issues

### Issue N: {title}
{Brief description}
**Impact:** {Low|Medium|High}
**Priority:** {P1|P2|P3}

## Architecture Context

- Language: {language}
- Framework: {framework}
- Database: {database}
- Test: {test_framework}
- Coverage target: {target}% (currently {current}%)

## Recent Changes Summary

**Last 3 commits:**
- {sha}: {message}
- {sha}: {message}
- {sha}: {message}

**Test Status:** {passing_count}/{total_count}
**Coverage:** {percentage}%
**Linting:** {Clean|Issues}
```

**Keep it concise:**
- Total file: ≤2000 words
- Each task summary: ≤100 words
- Each decision: ≤50 words
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW

### Step 5: Create Checkpoint

Save checkpoint metadata to `.workflow/state/checkpoints/`:

```json
{
  "checkpoint_id": "checkpoint_{timestamp}",
  "phase": "{current_phase}",
  "task": "{current_task_id}",
  "timestamp": "{ISO_8601_timestamp}",
  "git_sha": "{current_commit_sha}",
  "progress_file": ".workflow/state/progress.md",
  "session_summary": "{one_line_summary}",
  "next_phase": "{next_phase_description}",
  "context_usage_estimate": {percentage},
  "tasks_completed": {count},
  "decisions_made": {count}
}
```

### Step 6: Update Session State

Update `.workflow/state/session_state.json`:

```json
{
  "last_sync": "{timestamp}",
  "context_usage": {percentage},
  "checkpoint_count": {count},
  "sync_count": {count},
  "last_checkpoint": "{checkpoint_id}",
  "context_compressions": {count}
}
```

### Step 7: Determine Next Action

Based on context usage:

**<50% used:**
```
✓ Context sync complete
  - Progress saved to .workflow/state/progress.md
  - Checkpoint created: checkpoint_{id}
  - Context usage: {percentage}% (healthy)
  - Ready to continue work
```

**50-80% used:**
```
⚠ Context compression applied
  - Progress compressed and saved
  - Checkpoint created: checkpoint_{id}
  - Context usage: {percentage}% (compressed)
  - Non-essential details removed
  - Ready to continue with clean context
```

**>80% used OR force-spawn:**
```
🔄 Fresh agent required
  - Progress saved to .workflow/state/progress.md
  - Handoff notes prepared
  - Context usage: {percentage}% (critical)

  TO CONTINUE WORK:
  1. Spawn fresh agent (new session)
  2. Provide: .workflow/state/progress.md
  3. Fresh agent reads progress and resumes

  HANDOFF NOTES:
  - Track: {track_id}
  - Phase: {phase}
  - Next task: {task_id}
  - Current worktree: {path}
  - Known blockers: {list or None}
```

## Integration with Context Skill

This command implements the procedures from the **Context Window Management** skill:
- Load skill: `adaptive-workflow:context`
- Reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/context/SKILL.md`
- Apply thresholds, compression techniques, and handoff protocols from skill

**Key principles from skill:**
1. Context is finite, manage deliberately
2. Update progress after each task
3. Compress at 50%, spawn fresh at 80%
4. Task summaries ≤100 words
5. Decisions ≤50 words
6. Total progress ≤2000 words

## Signs That Sync Is Needed

Watch for these indicators:

**Agent Confusion:**
- Asking same question twice
- Modifying wrong files
- Forgetting recent decisions
- Mixing up task context

**Context Fragmentation:**
- Long responses with repeated information
- Difficulty maintaining focus
- Tangential discussions
- Loss of task tracking

**Memory Gaps:**
- Redoing completed work
- Not recalling recent decisions
- Asking about covered topics

**Action:** Run /workflow:context-sync immediately

## Error Handling

**Progress file doesn't exist:**
- Create new progress file from session state
- Initialize with current track/phase/task info
- Warn that no history available

**Session state corrupted:**
- Reconstruct from git log and plan file
- Create new session state
- Note reconstruction in progress file

**Cannot determine context usage:**
- Default to conservative estimate
- Recommend sync anyway
- Note uncertainty in checkpoint

**Git state unclear:**
- Show git status
- Ask user to clarify current state
- Do not proceed until confirmed

## Output Format

```markdown
## Context Sync Report

**Context Usage:** {percentage}% ({status})
**Action Taken:** {compression|fresh_spawn|none}

### Progress Checkpoint
- File: .workflow/state/progress.md
- Checkpoint: checkpoint_{id}
- Tasks completed: {count}
- Decisions captured: {count}

### Context Health
- Before sync: {before}%
- After sync: {after}%
- Tokens saved: ~{estimate}

### Session Stats
- Total syncs: {count}
- Total checkpoints: {count}
- Fresh spawns: {count}

{If fresh spawn needed:}
### Fresh Agent Handoff
📋 Handoff notes prepared in progress.md
🎯 Next task: {task_id}
⚠️ Known blockers: {list or None}
✓ Ready for fresh agent spawn
```

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Sync after each task completion in long sessions
- Compress early (at 50%) to prevent emergency spawns
- Keep progress file concise and focused
- Document key decisions immediately
- Create checkpoints at phase boundaries

**Don't:**
- Wait until context exhausted (>80%)
- Carry full conversation history indefinitely
- Skip progress file updates
- Compress current task context
- Lose critical decisions in compression

## Command Arguments

**No arguments:**
```bash
/workflow:context-sync
```
Auto-detect context usage and take appropriate action.

**Force fresh spawn:**
```bash
/workflow:context-sync force-spawn
```
Always prepare fresh agent handoff regardless of context usage.

## Related Commands

- `/workflow:metrics` - View session metrics including sync stats
- `/workflow:status` - Check current workflow state
- `/workflow:resume` - Resume work from progress file after fresh spawn

## Exit Conditions

**Success:** Progress saved, checkpoint created, action taken based on threshold
**Blocked:** Cannot determine state, user confirmation needed
**Error:** File write failure, git state unclear

Always report status clearly and indicate whether work can continue immediately or requires fresh spawn.
