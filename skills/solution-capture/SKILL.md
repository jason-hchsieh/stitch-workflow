# Solution Capture and Learning

## Core Principle

**Every problem solved is knowledge gained. Capture it systematically so future work builds on past learnings.**

This skill enforces structured solution documentation because undocumented solutions are lost knowledge. Compound engineering requires that each problem solved makes subsequent problems easier through institutional memory.

## When to Use

Auto-trigger during Phase 6 when:
- User says "that worked", "it's fixed", "problem solved"
- Issue successfully resolved after debugging
- Bug fixed and verified
- Performance improvement achieved
- Integration issue resolved
- Error pattern identified and corrected

Also use when:
- Creating new skill from repeated patterns
- Promoting solution to critical pattern
- Documenting architectural decisions
- Recording project conventions

## Solution Capture Process

### Step 1: Classify the Problem

Ask clarifying questions to classify:

**Problem Type** (enum):
- `performance_issue` - Slow execution, memory issues
- `database_issue` - Query problems, migrations, schema
- `security_issue` - Vulnerabilities, auth, encryption
- `ui_bug` - Visual issues, interaction problems
- `integration_issue` - API, third-party, service integration
- `configuration_issue` - Config, environment, deployment
- `dependency_issue` - Library conflicts, version problems
- `logic_error` - Business logic bugs
- `race_condition` - Timing, concurrency issues
- `memory_issue` - Leaks, excessive usage

**Component** (enum):
- `frontend` - UI components, client code
- `backend` - Server, business logic
- `database` - Schema, queries, migrations
- `api` - REST/GraphQL endpoints
- `auth` - Authentication, authorization
- `infrastructure` - Deployment, servers, cloud
- `cli` - Command-line interface
- `library` - Shared code, utilities
- `config` - Configuration files
- `test` - Testing infrastructure

**Root Cause** (enum):
- `missing_validation` - No input validation
- `missing_error_handling` - Unhandled exceptions
- `missing_null_check` - Null/undefined access
- `missing_await` - Forgot async/await
- `missing_index` - Database missing index
- `missing_include` - N+1 query, no eager loading
- `wrong_query` - Incorrect SQL/query logic
- `wrong_logic` - Business logic error
- `wrong_type` - Type mismatch
- `race_condition` - Timing issue
- `stale_cache` - Cache invalidation problem
- `config_mismatch` - Environment config wrong
- `dependency_conflict` - Library version conflict
- `api_deprecation` - Using deprecated API
- `schema_mismatch` - Data structure mismatch

**Severity**:
- `critical` - System down, data loss risk
- `high` - Major feature broken
- `medium` - Feature degraded
- `low` - Minor issue, workaround exists

### Step 2: Gather Solution Details

Collect comprehensive information:

**Required Fields:**
- Date (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Problem type, component, root cause, severity
- Symptoms (what was observed)
- Tags (searchable keywords)

**Optional Fields:**
- Module/class affected
- Related files
- Related issues (links to similar solutions)
- Promoted to pattern (boolean)

### Step 3: Structure the Solution

Use this template:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
problem_type: performance_issue
component: backend
root_cause: missing_include
severity: high
symptoms:
  - "N+1 query when loading email threads"
  - "Brief generation taking >5 seconds"
tags: [n-plus-one, eager-loading, performance]
module: BriefSystem
related_files:
  - app/models/brief.rb
  - app/services/brief_generator.rb
---

# N+1 Query in Brief Generation

## Problem

When generating briefs for users with many email threads, the
system was making one query per thread to fetch messages,
resulting in hundreds of queries and 5+ second response times.

## Root Cause

The Brief.includes() call was missing the nested :messages
association, causing lazy loading of messages for each thread
individually instead of eager loading them in a single query.

## Solution

Added .includes(threads: :messages) to the Brief query to
eager load all messages upfront:

```ruby
# Before (N+1 queries)
briefs = Brief.where(user_id: user.id).includes(:threads)

# After (2 queries)
briefs = Brief.where(user_id: user.id)
              .includes(threads: :messages)
```

## Code Example

```ruby
# File: app/services/brief_generator.rb

class BriefGenerator
  def generate_for_user(user)
    # Eager load all associations to avoid N+1
    briefs = Brief
      .where(user_id: user.id)
      .includes(threads: [:messages, :participants])
      .order(created_at: :desc)

    # Now accessing threads.messages doesn't trigger queries
    briefs.map { |brief| format_brief(brief) }
  end
end
```

## Verification

Measured with `Bullet` gem and Rails query logs:

Before:
- 247 queries
- 5.3 seconds

After:
- 3 queries
- 0.4 seconds

## Prevention

1. Always use `.includes()` for associations accessed in loops
2. Enable Bullet gem in development to detect N+1 queries
3. Review query logs during performance testing
4. Add test that asserts query count

```

### Step 4: Validate YAML Frontmatter

**BLOCKING:** YAML validation must pass before proceeding.

Validate:
- All required fields present
- Enums match allowed values exactly
- Date in ISO format
- Tags is array of strings
- Symptoms is array of strings

If validation fails:
- Show specific error
- Provide correct enum values
- Fix and re-validate
- Do not proceed until valid

### Step 5: Categorize and Store

Save to `.mycelium/solutions/{category}/`:

**Categories:**
- `performance-issues/` - Speed, memory, efficiency
- `database-issues/` - Queries, schema, migrations
- `security-issues/` - Auth, encryption, vulnerabilities
- `ui-bugs/` - Visual, interaction problems
- `integration-issues/` - API, third-party services
- `configuration-issues/` - Config, environment
- `dependency-issues/` - Libraries, versions

**Filename Format:**
`{descriptive-name}-{YYYYMMDD}.md`

Example: `n-plus-one-brief-20260203.md`

### Step 6: Pattern Detection

Check for repeated patterns:

**When 3+ similar issues exist:**
1. Identify common theme
2. Extract general pattern
3. Promote to `critical-patterns.md`
4. Link from individual solutions
5. Show pattern in all future sessions

**Critical Pattern Structure:**
```yaml
pattern_id: PAT-001
name: N+1 Query Prevention
severity: critical
occurrences: 5
promoted_from:
  - .mycelium/solutions/performance-issues/n-plus-one-brief.md
  - .mycelium/solutions/performance-issues/n-plus-one-users.md
problem_type: performance_issue
root_cause: missing_include
tags: [n-plus-one, database, performance]
```

## Knowledge Promotion Options

After capturing solution, offer choices:

### 1. Continue Workflow
- Solution stored, continue with next task
- Most common choice
- Knowledge available for future lookups

### 2. Add to Required Reading
- Promote to critical-patterns.md
- Shown at start of every session
- Use for critical/repeated patterns

### 3. Link Related Issues
- Connect to similar past solutions
- Build knowledge graph
- Easier to find related fixes

### 4. Add to Existing Skill
- Enhance existing skill with new example
- Update best practices
- Strengthen skill guidance

### 5. Create New Project Skill
- Generate dedicated skill for this pattern
- Use when pattern is project-specific
- Enables auto-application in future work

## Beyond Solutions: Learned Knowledge

Capture more than just problem-solutions:

### Decisions (.mycelium/learned/decisions/)

Document why choices were made:

```yaml
---
date: 2026-02-03
decision: Use PostgreSQL over MongoDB
category: database
status: accepted
---

# Database Selection: PostgreSQL

## Context
Need to store user data with complex relationships
and ensure ACID guarantees.

## Options Considered
1. PostgreSQL (chosen)
2. MongoDB
3. MySQL

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
and mature tooling ecosystem.

## Rationale
- Strong ACID guarantees needed
- Complex joins required
- JSON support available when needed
- Team has PostgreSQL expertise

## Consequences
- Must design normalized schema
- Migrations required for schema changes
- Benefits from strong consistency

## References
- Discussion: [link to PR/issue]
- Benchmark: [performance comparison]
```

### Conventions (.mycelium/learned/conventions/)

Document discovered project patterns:

```yaml
---
category: error_handling
last_updated: 2026-02-03
---

# Error Handling Convention

## Pattern
All API errors return consistent structure:

```typescript
{
  error: {
    code: "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    message: "Human readable message",
    details: {
      field: "email",
      reason: "invalid_format"
    }
  }
}
```

## Rationale
- Consistent client error handling
- Easier debugging
- Typed error codes

## Examples
See: src/utils/error-response.ts
```

### Preferences (.mycelium/learned/preferences.yaml)

Store user preferences learned over time:

```yaml
code_style:
  prefer_verbose_names: true
  max_function_length: 50
  comment_style: "doc_blocks_only"

testing:
  prefer_integration_over_e2e: true
  snapshot_tests_acceptable: false

communication:
  provide_reasoning: true
  show_alternatives: true
  explain_tradeoffs: true

workflow:
  commit_frequency: "per_task"
  review_depth: "standard"
  documentation_level: "inline_comments_plus_readme"
```

### Anti-Patterns (.mycelium/learned/anti-patterns/)

Document what NOT to do:

```yaml
---
anti_pattern: Mocking Everything
category: testing
severity: medium
---

# Anti-Pattern: Over-Mocking in Tests

## What NOT To Do
```typescript
// BAD: Mocking everything
jest.mock('./user-service')
jest.mock('./email-service')
jest.mock('./database')
jest.mock('./logger')
```

## Why It's Bad
- Tests don't verify real integration
- Mocks can diverge from real implementation
- False confidence in test coverage

## What To Do Instead
```typescript
// GOOD: Test real integration, mock only external services
import { UserService } from './user-service'
import { EmailService } from './email-service'

jest.mock('./external-email-api') // Only mock external boundary
```

## When Discovered
Multiple bugs in production that passed tests
because mocked services didn't match real behavior.
```

### Effective Prompts (.mycelium/learned/effective-prompts/)

Capture approaches that work well:

```yaml
---
task: debugging_race_conditions
effectiveness: high
---

# Effective Prompt: Race Condition Debugging

## Prompt Structure
"I have a race condition in [component]. Here's the sequence:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Expected: X, Actual: Y]

Help me identify critical sections and add proper synchronization."

## Why It Works
- Provides sequence of events
- Shows expected vs actual
- Focuses on synchronization

## Example Results
- Identified missing mutex in cache access
- Found async callback ordering issue
- Discovered missing await in promise chain

## When To Use
- Intermittent failures
- Timing-dependent bugs
- Concurrent access issues
```

## Auto-Generation: Project Skills

When pattern is strong enough, generate skill:

### Trigger Conditions
- 3+ solutions with same root cause
- Pattern affects multiple components
- High severity or frequent occurrence
- Clear prevention strategy exists

### Generation Process
1. Extract common elements from solutions
2. Identify prevention strategies
3. Generate skill structure
4. Include code examples
5. Add to project skills directory
6. Register for auto-discovery

### Generated Skill Example
```yaml
---
name: N+1 Query Prevention
description: Auto-apply when working with database queries in this project
scope: project
auto_trigger: true
---

# N+1 Query Prevention (Project Skill)

Automatically generated from 5 occurrences of N+1 query issues.

## Detection
This skill triggers when:
- Working with ActiveRecord associations
- Iterating over collections
- Accessing related models

## Prevention
Always use `.includes()` for associations:

[Auto-generated examples from solutions...]
```

## Search and Retrieval

Make solutions discoverable:

### By Problem Type
```bash
find .mycelium/solutions/performance-issues/ -name "*.md"
```

### By Tag
```bash
grep -r "tags:.*n-plus-one" .mycelium/solutions/
```

### By Component
```bash
grep -r "component: backend" .mycelium/solutions/
```

### By Date Range
```bash
find .mycelium/solutions/ -name "*-202602*.md"
```

### Smart Search
Use `grep` with context to find relevant solutions:
```bash
grep -r "N+1 query" .mycelium/solutions/ -A 5 -B 5
```

## Integration with Workflow

**Phase 0: Context Loading**
- Load critical-patterns.md
- Search relevant prior solutions
- Apply learned preferences

**Phase 4: Implementation**
- Check for similar past issues
- Apply known solutions
- Reference established conventions

**Phase 6: Compound Learning (THIS SKILL)**
- Capture solution systematically
- Detect patterns
- Promote to critical patterns
- Generate skills when appropriate
- Update learned knowledge

## Validation Requirements

YAML validation is BLOCKING:

### Required Enum Values
```yaml
problem_type: [performance_issue, database_issue, security_issue,
               ui_bug, integration_issue, configuration_issue,
               dependency_issue, logic_error, race_condition,
               memory_issue]

component: [frontend, backend, database, api, auth,
           infrastructure, cli, library, config, test]

root_cause: [missing_validation, missing_error_handling,
            missing_null_check, missing_await, missing_index,
            missing_include, wrong_query, wrong_logic,
            wrong_type, race_condition, stale_cache,
            config_mismatch, dependency_conflict,
            api_deprecation, schema_mismatch]

severity: [critical, high, medium, low]
```

### Required Arrays
- `symptoms`: Must have at least 1 item
- `tags`: Must have at least 1 item

### Optional Fields
- All other fields are optional
- Include when information available
- Better documentation aids future lookup

## Common Capture Mistakes

### Too Vague
❌ **Bad:**
```yaml
problem_type: logic_error
symptoms:
  - "It didn't work"
```

✅ **Good:**
```yaml
problem_type: logic_error
root_cause: missing_validation
symptoms:
  - "Email validation regex rejected valid .museum domains"
  - "Users with museum email addresses couldn't register"
tags: [email, validation, regex, domain]
```

### Missing Context
❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
## Problem
The query was slow.

## Solution
Added an index.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
## Problem
User search queries taking 8+ seconds on 100k user database.
Full table scan on users table for email lookups.

## Solution
Added composite index on users(email, status) for common
search pattern. Query time reduced from 8s to 45ms.

## Verification
- Ran EXPLAIN ANALYZE before: Seq Scan
- After: Index Scan using idx_users_email_status
- Benchmark: 8.2s → 0.045s (182x faster)
```

### No Reproduction Steps
❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
## Problem
Race condition in cache.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
## Problem
Race condition when multiple workers update same cache key:
1. Worker A reads cache (miss)
2. Worker B reads cache (miss)
3. Worker A writes cache
4. Worker B writes cache (overwrites A)
Result: Latest write wins, A's work lost

## Solution
Added mutex around cache read-write:
[code example with lock]
```

## Summary

**Key principles:**
- Capture solutions systematically, not ad-hoc
- Validate YAML frontmatter (blocking requirement)
- Categorize for future discovery
- Detect and promote patterns
- Go beyond problems: capture decisions, conventions, preferences
- Make knowledge searchable and reusable
- Generate project skills from repeated patterns
- Every solved problem compounds future capability

Solution capture is not overhead - it's the mechanism that makes each unit of work accelerate subsequent work.
