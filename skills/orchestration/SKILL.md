# Autonomous Workflow Orchestration

This skill guides autonomous execution of the complete mycelium workflow: plan → work → review → capture.

## When to Use This Skill

- When executing `/mycelium-go [task]`
- For end-to-end autonomous development, debugging, or investigation
- When user wants minimal interaction
- For routine/clear tasks with established patterns
- For debugging issues or answering technical questions
- When resuming via `/mycelium-continue` in full mode

## Continue Mode

When invoked from `/mycelium-continue`, the orchestration skill resumes from a saved checkpoint rather than starting fresh.

### Phase Mapping

Map `current_phase` in `session_state.json` to named phases:

| `current_phase` value | Phase name | Phase number |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------|
| `planning` | Plan | 1 |
| `implementation` | Work | 2 |
| `review` | Review | 3 |
| `capture` | Capture | 4 |

### Start-From Logic

1. Read `current_phase` and `checkpoints` from `session_state.json`
2. Skip any phase already marked complete in checkpoints (e.g., `planning_complete` timestamp exists → skip Plan)
3. Begin at the current phase, resuming from its checkpoint (e.g., `last_task_completed: "1.2"` → start at task 1.3)
4. Chain through all remaining phases to completion

### Mid-Phase Resumption

- Read `.workflow/state/progress.md` for completed work summary
- Check plan markers (`[x]` = done, `[~]` = in progress, `[ ]` = pending)
- Resume the `[~]` or next `[ ]` task within the current phase
- Verify test baseline passes before continuing work

## Overview

The orchestration skill manages the full development lifecycle with minimal human intervention, stopping only when critical decisions are needed or blockers are encountered.

---

## Execution Modes

### Autonomous Mode (Default)

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal user interaction
- Auto-proceeds when path is clear
- Only stops for critical decisions
- Fast execution

**When to stop**:
- Ambiguous requirements (multiple valid interpretations)
- High-risk changes (security, payments, data)
- P1 issues in review
- Tests failing after 3 attempts
- Missing information that cannot be inferred

**When to auto-proceed**:
- Requirements are clear and specific
- Plan has no blockers or dependencies
- All tests pass
- Only P2/P3 review issues (note them, continue)
- Patterns exist in codebase

### Interactive Mode (`--interactive`)

**Characteristics**:
- Approval required at each phase
- User oversight throughout
- Slower but more controlled
- Good for learning or high-stakes changes

**When to ask**:
- After plan creation: "Approve plan?"
- After implementation: "Proceed to review?"
- After review: "Fix issues or accept?"
- After capture: "Learnings captured, continue?"

---

## Phase 1: Planning

### Input Processing

**Parse task description**:
```
User input: "Add user authentication with JWT"

Extract:
- Feature: User authentication
- Technical approach: JWT
- Scope: {to be clarified}
```

### Load Context

**Read project context**:
```bash
# Project information
cat .workflow/context/product.md
cat .workflow/context/tech-stack.md
cat .workflow/context/workflow.md
cat CLAUDE.md

# Prior knowledge
cat .workflow/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md
ls .workflow/solutions/

# Session state
cat .workflow/state/session_state.json
```

### Discover Capabilities

**Extract available skills and agents from the current session:**

1. **Skills** - Check ALL sources and merge (deduplicate by name):
   - Primary: The system-reminder block listing skills for the Skill tool. Extract every `plugin:skill-name` entry.
   - Note: The system-reminder may NOT list all registered skills due to context optimization. Some plugin skills may be registered but not injected. Acknowledge any known gaps.

2. **Agents** - Read the Task tool description COMPLETELY. Extract EVERY agent under "Available agent types and the tools they have access to":
   - Built-in agents (Bash, general-purpose, Explore, Plan, claude-code-guide, statusline-setup, etc.)
   - Plugin agents (e.g., code-simplifier:*, mycelium:*, etc.)
   - IMPORTANT: Do not skip any. Read the FULL list. Commonly missed: `claude-code-guide`, `statusline-setup`.

3. **MCP Tools** - Check for any MCP server tools in the current session. MCP servers provide additional tools beyond the built-in set. Look for MCP-provided tools in the tool list or system prompt.

4. **Cache discovered capabilities** in `.workflow/state/session_state.json`:
```json
{
  "discovered_capabilities": {
    "skills": [
      { "name": "mycelium:planning", "description": "..." },
      { "name": "mycelium:tdd", "description": "..." }
    ],
    "agents": [
      { "name": "general-purpose", "tools": ["*"], "best_for": "..." },
      { "name": "Bash", "tools": ["Bash"], "best_for": "..." }
    ],
    "mcp_tools": [
      { "name": "tool-name", "server": "mcp-server-name", "description": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

5. **Use cached capabilities** when assigning agents/skills to tasks in the plan. Only assign capabilities that exist in the discovered list.

### Invoke Planning Skill

**Load**: `planning` skill

**Execute planning workflow**:
1. Clarify requirements (Phase 1)
2. Smart research gate (Phase 1.5)
3. Discover capabilities (Phase 2) - use cached capabilities from above
4. Create plan (Phase 3)

**Decision gate** (Autonomous):
```
Requirements clear? (yes/no)
- If yes: Auto-proceed
- If no: Ask clarifying questions

Example:
  "Add user authentication" is AMBIGUOUS
  - Which auth method? (OAuth, JWT, session)
  - Registration included?
  - Password requirements?

  → STOP and ask
```

**Decision gate** (Interactive):
```
📋 Plan created: 8 tasks across 3 phases

[Show task breakdown]

❓ Approve plan? (yes/no/modify)
```

**Output**:
- Plan saved to `.workflow/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{track_id}.md`
- Track ID stored in session_state.json

**Error handling**:
- If planning fails: Report error, STOP
- If user rejects plan: Iterate or exit
- If requirements unclear: Ask questions, don't assume

---

## Phase 2: Implementation

### Pre-flight Checks

**Verify baseline**:
```bash
# Run existing tests
{test_command}

# Must all pass before new work
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Baseline tests failing"
  echo "Fix existing tests before new work"
  STOP
fi
```

**Check uncommitted changes**:
```bash
git status --porcelain

# If dirty working tree:
# Autonomous: Stash changes
# Interactive: Ask "Stash changes? (yes/no)"
```

### Invoke TDD and Verification Skills

**Load**:
- `tdd` (mandatory)
- `verification` (mandatory)

**Execute implementation**:

For EACH task in plan (or parallel if dependencies allow):

1. **Mark task in-progress**:
   ```markdown
   [~] Task 1.1: Setup auth module
   ```

2. **Search for patterns**:
   ```bash
   # Find similar implementations
   grep -r "auth\|authentication" src/

   # Check for learned patterns
   cat .workflow/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md
   ```

3. **Apply TDD cycle** (from tdd skill):
   ```
   RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

   1. Write failing test
   2. Verify RED (test fails)
   3. Write minimal implementation
   4. Verify GREEN (test passes)
   5. Refactor if needed
   ```

4. **Verify with evidence**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   {test_command}

   # Show output
   # Verify exit code = 0
   # Check coverage
   ```

5. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git add {files}
   git commit -m "Task 1.1: Setup auth module

   - Add User model with password hashing
   - Add JWT token generation

   Tests: All pass (32/32)
   Coverage: 85%

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

6. **Mark task complete**:
   ```markdown
   [x] Task 1.1: Setup auth module `abc1234`
   ```

### Decision Gates

**Autonomous mode**:
- Tests pass → Auto-proceed
- Tests fail (attempt 1-3) → Debug and fix
- Tests fail (attempt 4+) → STOP, report blocker
- Pattern exists → Follow pattern
- No pattern → Create new, document

**Interactive mode**:
```
✅ Task 1.1 complete (tests pass, coverage 85%)

Next: Task 1.2 (Add login endpoint)

❓ Continue? (yes/no/pause)
```

### Parallel Execution

If tasks have no dependencies (`blockedBy: []`):

```
Tasks ready for parallel execution:
- Task 2.1: Add login endpoint
- Task 2.2: Add logout endpoint
- Task 2.3: Add token refresh

Creating worktrees...
├── .worktrees/auth_20260204_2.1/
├── .worktrees/auth_20260204_2.2/
└── .worktrees/auth_20260204_2.3/

Executing in parallel...
```

Use Task tool to dispatch subagents for each task.

**Merge strategy**:
1. Wait for task completion
2. Verify tests in worktree
3. Merge to main
4. Run full test suite
5. If conflicts: Resolve, retest
6. Remove worktree
7. Unblock dependent tasks

### Progress Reporting

**Autonomous mode**:
```
🤖 Working...
   ✓ Task 1.1: Auth module (tests pass)
   ✓ Task 1.2: Login endpoint (tests pass)
   ⏳ Task 1.3: Session management (in progress)
```

**Interactive mode**:
```
✅ Tasks 1.1 - 1.3 complete (3/8)

Progress: ▓▓▓░░░░░ 37%

❓ Continue to Task 1.4? (yes/no/status)
```

### Error Recovery

**Test failures**:
```
Attempt 1: Fix attempt #1
Attempt 2: Fix attempt #2
Attempt 3: Fix attempt #3
Attempt 4: STOP

❌ Tests still failing after 3 fix attempts

Issue: {description}
Last error: {error message}

Blocker detected. Stopping for user input.

Options:
1. Debug manually
2. Simplify approach
3. Skip this task (not recommended)
```

**Blocked on external dependency**:
```
⚠️ Task 2.3 blocked: Waiting for API key from user

Cannot proceed automatically.
Please provide API key and resume.
```

**Priority:** P1
**File:** src/auth/login.ts:45
**Fix:** Use parameterized queries
**Effort:** 15 min
```

**Execute fixes**:
- Follow TDD cycle
- Verify fix doesn't break existing tests
- Re-run affected review agents
- Confirm issue resolved

## Orchestration State Management

Throughout execution, maintain state in `session_state.json`:

```json
{
  "current_track": "auth_20260204",
  "current_phase": "implementation",
  "current_task": "1.3",
  "mode": "autonomous",
  "checkpoints": {
    "planning_complete": "2026-02-04T10:15:00Z",
    "implementation_started": "2026-02-04T10:20:00Z",
    "last_task_completed": "1.2",
    "last_commit": "abc1234"
  },
  "blockers": [],
  "decisions_made": [
    {
      "decision": "Use JWT for authentication",
      "rationale": "Stateless, scalable",
      "timestamp": "2026-02-04T10:12:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Save state**:
- After each phase completion
- After each task completion
- Before asking user questions
- On error/blocker

**Resume support**:
If interrupted, can resume from last checkpoint using `/mycelium-continue`. Use `/mycelium-continue --full` to force full orchestration mode regardless of how the workflow was originally started.

## Decision Matrix

### When to STOP and Ask (Both Modes)

| Scenario | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Ambiguous requirements | ASK | "Add auth" → Which method? |
| High-risk change | ASK | Changing payment logic |
| P1 review issues | STOP | SQL injection found |
| Tests fail 3+ times | STOP | Cannot fix automatically |
| Missing credentials | ASK | Need API key |
| Architectural decision | ASK | Monolith vs microservices |

### When to AUTO-PROCEED (Autonomous Only)

| Scenario | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Clear requirements | GO | "Add JWT auth with bcrypt" |
| Pattern exists | GO | Found similar auth in codebase |
| Tests passing | GO | All green, proceed |
| P2/P3 issues only | GO | Note issues, continue |
| Standard task | GO | CRUD operations |

---

## Error Handling

**Planning fails**:
```
❌ Planning failed: {reason}

Cannot proceed without plan.
Stopping.

Suggested: Clarify requirements and retry
```

**Implementation blocked**:
```
⚠️ Implementation blocked: {reason}

Completed: 5/8 tasks
Blocked on: Task 1.6 (missing API key)

Saving state...
Resume with: /mycelium-continue
```

**Review finds P1 issues**:
```
❌ Review FAILED: 2 critical (P1) issues

P1 Issues:
1. SQL injection vulnerability
2. Hardcoded credentials

These MUST be fixed before merge.

Stopping for fixes.
```

**Knowledge capture fails**:
```
⚠️ Knowledge capture failed: {reason}

Work is complete but learnings not captured.

Options:
1. Retry capture: /mycelium-capture
2. Continue anyway (learnings lost)
```

---

## Performance Optimization

**Parallel execution**:
- Use worktrees for independent tasks
- Dispatch multiple subagents
- Merge results as they complete

**Smart caching**:
- Load context once, reuse
- Cache grep results
- Reuse test runs if code unchanged

**Progress streaming**:
- Update UI incrementally
- Don't wait for phase completion
- Show real-time progress

---

## Important Notes

- **Save state frequently** - Enable resume on interruption
- **Evidence-based decisions** - Don't assume, verify
- **TDD is mandatory** - No code without tests
- **Stop on P1 issues** - Security/correctness first
- **Capture learnings** - Build knowledge layer
- **Respect user preferences** - Check workflow.md for policies
- **Be transparent** - Show what's happening
- **Fail gracefully** - Clear error messages, suggest fixes

---

- [ ] Plan created and approved
- [ ] All tasks completed with passing tests
- [ ] Coverage meets target
- [ ] No P1 issues in review
- [ ] Learnings captured
- [ ] State saved for resume capability
